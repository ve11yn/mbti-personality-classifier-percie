# Percie
Percie is a web application built with React + Vite + TypeScript on the frontend and Flask on the backend. It is designed to classify MBTI personality types based on user input.

# MBTI Overview
The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a personality classification system that categorizes individuals into 16 personality types based on four key dimensions:
- Extraversion (E) vs. Introversion (I) – How you gain energy (social interactions vs. solitude).
- Sensing (S) vs. Intuition (N) – How you process information (facts vs. patterns).
- Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F) – How you make decisions (logic vs. emotions).
- Judging (J) vs. Perceiving (P) – How you approach life (structured vs. flexible).
Each person falls into one of 16 personality types (e.g., INFJ, ENTP, ISTP), which can provide insights into their behavior, decision-making, and interactions.
Percie predicts MBTI types based on user input, helping users explore their personality traits.

# Disclaimer
The model currently achieves 88% accuracy. However, its predictions rely on specific keywords in the input prompt. If certain key terms are missing, the results may be less accurate. Future improvements are planned to enhance both accuracy and flexibility.

# How to Use
Describe yourself in the prompt field and the model will predict your MBTI personality type.
